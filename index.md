## STA314 Statictical Methods to Machine Learning I


### Week 10

...

Consider the samples $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$. Draw samples with replacement until we have another set of samples $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$. Thus it follows that the probability of choosing any one item is $\frac{1}{n}$ and the probability of not choosing this item is $1-\frac{1}{n}$. By independence of the samples, until the draw of $x_n$, we have the probability of not choosing any sample is $(1-\frac{1}{n})^n$. Now, if $n$ goes to infinity, the approximation of the original observations presented in each bootstrap sample is 
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty } \Big(1- (1-\frac{1}{n})^n \Big)= \Big(1- \frac{1}{e} \Big) \approx 0.632$$
